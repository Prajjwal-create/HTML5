    <h1> Creating links in HTML</h1>
     <p>A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
         Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on 
         any server anywhere in the world.</p>



      <p>  A link has two ends, called anchors. The link starts at the source 
          anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web 
          resource, for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, 
          an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.</p>

    <p>
   nn MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database 
    management system (RDBMS).[5][6] Its name is a combination of "My",
     the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the
      abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database
       organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other;
        these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and 
        extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relation</p>

        <p>MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational
             database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows 
             for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and 
             f backups.</p>

        <p>vMySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU
             General Public License, and is also available under a variety of
              proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish
               company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems ></p>
